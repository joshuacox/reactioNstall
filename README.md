Install Reaction PDQ

This is an UN-official install for reaction at the moment I support all
Linux distros, please submit an issue if yours is not present, or feel
free to submit a Pull Request.  Do not ask for support from the official
reaction team.  This is a solo experiment and the only place to receive
support is by submitting an issue here.
